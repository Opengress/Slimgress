    I think it'd be nice to add styles from https://github.com/Cypher01/Xglyph2,
    where "make stuff look like x" is already solved.
    I haven't, because such an action is forbidden by the licence (XGlyph2 is GPL).

    Now, on the one other hand,
    Media.net Advertising FZ-LLC v. Netseer, Inc gave us a world (or at least a country) where
    style/layout information is not really copyrightable since it's just "methods":
    https://aeonlaw.com/blog/2016/02/22/copyright-protection-css-and-html/

    Then again, the style stuff in XGlyph is reimplemented based on the look and feel of another
    application.
    If the look *itself* is protected,
    then it's proprietary (yeah, right. again, "formatting methods") ...

    Either way,
    given its nature I don't think anyone can really claim copyright on that particular portion.

    On the OTHER other hand,
    Cypher01 DID do the work of writing all that XML, and law aside,
    it would be polite to ASK before pulling all the button (etc) styles out of his application.
    I haven't asked, so I won't do it, at this moment.

    Finally, that isn't necessarily the correct look for THIS application.
    Maybe all the branding is wrong.
    What is the branding like in IITC? That's original, right? What is its licence?
    The point is, maybe it CAN look how XGlyph2 looks, and maybe it doesn't HAVE to look like that.

    At the moment this application is mostly done in black/charcoal/granite tones,
    and so far that mostly serves it very well.

    I should change the highlight colour, though, at runtime. Blue on every screen, lol.
